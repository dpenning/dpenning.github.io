        <p>Hey somebody's reading this! I'm David Pennington. I'm a student of Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Kentucky. I am the head programmer for the UK Solar Car, Co-Chair of the IEEE Hardware Team, member of the IEEE, ACM, UKYLUG, UKSolarCar. My career has mostly been in the field of network engineering, as I have worked at Cincinnati Bell as a network engineering intern and have done freelance work for a couple startups. I currently work for the SDN research team at UK building Software Defined Networks.</p>

<p>Now that that's out of the way, I'll tell you a little about myself. </p>

<ul>
<li>I LOVE PYTHON, and I still haven't decided whether to keep using 2.7.5 or move on to 3.</li>
<li>I also love to compete in coding competitions. Recently My team and I scored 102nd in IEEE Extreme, Our team scored 9th for Python users.</li>
<li>I love learning about the combination of math and computation. The subject that has interested me in the last couple of weeks has been solving problems and making art with cellular automata. I also currently in the top 3% of users in Project Euler.</li>
<li>My hobbies in the real world include painting, watching whole series of TV shows in one sitting, playing various instruments, going to listen to live music, and hanging out with programmers.</li>
<li>I love good food, and hope to be able to make sometime in the future. </li>
<li>I play a little golf, basketball, and racquetball when I get the chance.</li>
