Recently My team and I scored 102nd in IEEE Extreme, Our team scored 9th for Python users.\r\n* I love learning about the combination of math and computation. The subject that has interested me in the last couple of weeks has been solving problems and making art with cellular automata. I also currently in the top 3% of users in Project Euler.\r\n* My hobbies in the real world include painting, watching whole series of TV shows in one sitting, playing various instruments, going to listen to live music, and hanging out with programmers.\r\n* I love good food, and hope to be able to make sometime in the future. \r\n* I play a little golf, basketball, and racquetball when I get the chance.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
